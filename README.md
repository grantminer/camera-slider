# Automated Camera Slider

For this project, we are attempting to create an automated camera sliding robot for use in videography. The robot will consist of a one-axis gantry that will slide the camera mount across a set of rails using a pulley system and a stepper motor. The entire setup will likely be run with an Arduino controller. More detail will be added to this description as the project develops.
